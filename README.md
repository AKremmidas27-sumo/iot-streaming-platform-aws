# iot-streaming-platform-aws

## Developer: Andrew Kremmidas — AWS Solutions Architect Associate

IoT Streaming Platform on AWS
Real-Time Data Ingestion • Analytics • Monitoring

A highly scalable streaming pipeline built to ingest massive volumes of IoT device telemetry in real time, apply intelligent processing, store results efficiently, and visualize device health and patterns instantly.
Designed with event-driven serverless architecture — no servers to manage, globally scalable.

Core Capabilities
Capability	Why It Matters
Real-time streaming ingestion	Mission-critical industrial & smart device analytics
Serverless data processing	Auto-scale for millions of messages/sec
Time-series data storage	Fast lookup + trend insight
Live monitoring dashboards	Business & operational visibility
Secure device connectivity	Compliance-ready IoT security
Used for: Smart Cities, Automotive, Healthcare Devices, Manufacturing Sensors, Consumer IoT fleets.

QuickSight + S3 Data Lake               Real-Time Monitoring API
Optional enterprise add-ons:
Machine Learning with SageMaker + anomaly detection
Edge processing with Greengrass for offline sites

Security + Compliance
✔ Device identity via IoT Certificates
✔ AWS IoT Policies for scoped access
✔ KMS encryption for data at rest
✔ TLS encryption for data in transit
✔ CloudWatch & IoT Monitor audit logs
Every device must prove who it is before data is accepted.

Data Flow Example
Stage	Action
Device sends telemetry	MQTT publish → IoT Core
Rule triggers forward	IoT Core → Kinesis Stream
Processing	Lambda parses, validates, enriches
Persistence	DynamoDB stores most recent state
Analytics	S3 lake + Athena query + QuickSight dashboards
Latency target: < 1 second from device → insights

Example Telemetry Payload
{
  "deviceId": "sensor-001",
  "timestamp": 1733000000,
  "temp": 72.4,
  "humidity": 34,
  "battery": 89
}
Lambda cleans and enriches fields (geo-tagging, alerts, anomalies).

Visual Insights
Cloud dashboards show:
Device battery health
Temperature drift over time
Offline device detection
Fleet-wide averages & alert rates
Real-time error/anomaly flags
These dashboards replicate common SRE + IoT operations views companies rely on.

Testing Example (Device Simulator)
python simulate.py \
  --device sensor-001 \
  --rate 2 \
  --mqtt_url $IOT_ENDPOINT
Simulates a growing fleet at increasing message loads.

Cost Efficiency
AWS Service	Cost Strategy
Kinesis	Auto-scaling shards
DynamoDB	On-demand billing & TTL cleanup
S3	Lifecycle → Glacier
Lambda	Pay per message batch
QuickSight	Reader accounts for dashboards only
Designed for global scale at minimal operational overhead.

Future Enhancements
SageMaker anomaly detection for predictive maintenance
Greengrass edge deployments for factories & remote sites
OTA (over-the-air) firmware update pipeline
Digital twin system with Device Shadow analytics
WebSockets dashboard for live updates

Overall Project Goal
Deliver a production-grade IoT streaming pipeline that can scale to millions of devices, while remaining secure, reliable, and cost-efficient.
Perfect for industries transforming via IoT data intelligence.
